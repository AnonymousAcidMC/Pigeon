# WARNING: This mod is kinda broken right now
Use this mod at a risk of randomly crashing with other mods. 
As of right now, I am unfortunately not working on this mod as I am currently focusing on the Bevy game engine and the Rapier physics engine.
Maybe check out those repositories if you are interested.
